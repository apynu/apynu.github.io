rebuild of my blog
# Requirements
I have a few requirements that I want fullfilled.
- [x] LiveLoading: all or at least most of the pages should be able to be live loaded, because thats cool
- [x] github pages hostable: needs to be hostable on github pages as I'm too cheap to rent a server >.<
- [ ] md to html compiler: I only want to write md blog that are then just compiled to html
