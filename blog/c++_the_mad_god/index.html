		<p style="margin-top: 0px;">
			I've been writing C++ for about 2500h now, which, by its standards, isn't a long time, but its a lot longer than most people who criticise it have.
			<br>In this post I want to talk about the good, the bad and the mad of C++ from the eyes of someone a little experienced.
		</p>
		<h2>1. The Bad</h2>
		<p>
			When giving critical feedback we should always pack it between two good things, 
			though we're talking about C++ here, so we'll start with the bad continue with the good and end with the mad
		</p>
		<h3>1.1 Complexity</h3>
		<p>
			Its astounding how complex a language can get, 
			and C++ has to be one of the most complex languages that I've ever used (and I prize myself with having used a bunch of different languages).
			The amount of features that it has makes it so one team could write their code with a completely different feature set than another team,
			which makes colaboration between teams difficult.
		</p>
		<p>Not to mention that on can never know all features or C++</p>
		<h3>1.2 Technical Language Debt</h3>
		<p>-lots of old features that shouldn't be used: e.g. trailing return types</p>
		<p>-makes it mandatory to maintain legacy code</p>
		<h3>1.3 Programmer speed</h3>
		<p>-due to how C++ works, programming in rust get results faster than in C++</p>
		<h2>2. The Good</h2>
		<h3>2.1 C Compatibility</h3>
		<h3>2.2 Speed</h3>
		<h3>2.3 Long History</h3>
		<h2>3. The Mad</h2>
